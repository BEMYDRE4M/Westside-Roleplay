# Westside Roleplay

This gamemode was worked on in 2014 and 2015. It was my first attempt at scripting. This gamemode is not self-made. It is based on an existing gamemode (Vio-Extended) which I modified and expanded.

⚠️ **Note:** This gamemode is extremely outdated and does **NOT** use MTA's internal database functions. It requires the MySQL module, which is no longer compatible with newer MySQL versions. To get the script running, SSL verification must be disabled.. Many systems of the gamemode are probably no longer working correctly and need to be updated too.   
Development and support have been discontinued; this upload serves mainly for archiving.

The gamemode is in German.
