# Westside Roleplay

Westside Roleplay is a German-language roleplay gamemode for the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas multiplayer modification Multi Theft Auto, which was developed between 2014 and 2015. Westside Roleplay is based on the German-language roleplay gamemode Vio-Extended.

This gamemode is extremely outdated and was last updated in 2015. It does not use Multi Theft Auto’s internal database functions, which means it requires the MySQL module to establish a database connection. Since the MySQL module is not compatible with newer MySQL versions, it only works if SSL verification is disabled beforehand.
(Of course, you can also simply use an older MySQL version.)

Due to the age of the gamemode, some systems may not function perfectly, but the gamemode works in general.

The project Westside Roleplay has been discontinued. Development and support have been terminated.
